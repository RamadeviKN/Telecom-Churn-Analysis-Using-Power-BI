# Telecom-Churn-Analysis-Using-Power-BI

🚀 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer churn patterns using SQL ETL workflows, Power Query transformations, and Power BI dashboards. The analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, helping telecom companies identify churn trends, optimize marketing strategies, and improve overall customer retention.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI – Data visualization and interactive dashboards.

Power Query – Data transformation and preprocessing.

Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) – Database management and ETL operations.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculated columns.


📂 Project Workflow

1️⃣ SQL ETL Steps:

Extracted raw data from SQL Server databases.

Cleaned and pre-processed data using SQL queries.

Performed data aggregation, joins, and subqueries.

Created optimized views for efficient Power BI integration.


2️⃣ Power Query Transformations:

Imported data from SQL Server into Power BI via Power Query.

Handled data type conversions and value replacements.

Removed duplicates and managed null values.

Used Unpivot Columns to ensure analysis flexibility.

Created custom columns for calculated fields.


3️⃣ Power BI Dashboards:

Designed multiple dashboards to represent insights effectively:

Customer Overview: Total customers, new joiners, churn count, and churn rate.

Demographic: Churn analysis based on gender and age groups.

Geographic: City-wise churn distribution and hotspots.

Account Information: Insights into payment methods, contract types, and tenure groups.

Service-Based: Churn trends by internet service type and additional services.


📊 Key Insights

Identify high-risk customer segments prone to churn.

Optimize targeted marketing campaigns for specific demographics.

Improve service offerings based on churn trends.

Analyze regional and service-based churn patterns for better resource allocation.
